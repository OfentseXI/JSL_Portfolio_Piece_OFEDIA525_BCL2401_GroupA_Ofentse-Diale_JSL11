# Project Overview
With the use of user stories the objective of the project is to create an Agile Board - Kanban Task Management app with the specifications laid out in the user stories. The Purpose of the application is to add and manage multiple tasks.

# Project Brief
To create the project there is a starter code provided with little to none functionality. With that we are required to complete the task by adding the necessary codeto functions that are set by not complete. Anotther requirement is to debug the whole of the starter code in order to have the code function as needed and described in the user story. By fullfiling all the necessary requirements and adding a few extra elements to the project a function Kanban task management applictaion is completed. 

# Reflections 
The overall completion of the task came with it's challenges and frustrations, working through all the code to find and debug bugs proved to be one of the most frustrating aspects of the project. I also found it frustrating that the final product doesn't display until you get to the end of the code, so if there were any mistakes throughout, you would not necessarily see them until you would get to the end. 

### Areas of mastery
I found most of the functions fairly easy to work on, correct and implement to the functionality requirements.
Another aspect i found fairly easy was importing the taskFunctions and utilities that were provided in to the index.js file.

### Challenges faced 
I found the local storage aspect of the project to be particularly complicated because at one point while i was working testing the functionality of the code, certain things would dissapear, like the roadmap and launch career. I then later figured out how to reset the local storage to the default setting.

### Areas of Improvement 
I need to get more familiar with the functionality of the local storage application because its the one aspect i had plenty trouble with, apart from that i feel confident in how i managed to complete the project. 

## Overall learningÂ experience
One major thing i learnt is the usefulness of creating a separate file for functions, then importing them into the code you're working on, that creates a lot less clutter in the code.
I also learnt the importance of User stories in coding.
